## About **COSINX**

At **cosinx**, we are committed to transforming the landscape of drug discovery and scientific research with our innovative AI-driven solutions. **cosinx** symbolizes the integration of life elements—Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N)—with Silicon (Si), representing AI. The "X" in our name stands for the unknown and embodies the spirit of discovery, emphasizing the importance of scientific research.

Our suite of products includes:

### **MindPlot**: [mindplot.ai](https://mindplot.ai)
A powerful fine-tuned LLM tool for advanced scientific visualization, enabling students and researchers to create insightful and publishable plots from complex datasets. We aim to streamline data cleaning, statistical analysis, multi-style plotting, and data interpretation into a single click, while our multi-agent design allows for fast and accurate figure refinement and style customization in a conversational manner. Our goal is to empower users to focus on scientific questions and insights, rather than the technical details of data processing and visualization.

### **MindGene**: [mindgene.ai](https://mindgene.ai)
We are developing a suite of phenotype-driven AI models specialized for compounds, genes, proteins, RNAs, and cells. Our models are designed to predict bindings, targets, toxicity, side effects, potential functions, and molecular mechanisms of these biological molecules. Current AI models focus on predicting molecular structures and interactions, while neglecting the phenotypic outcomes of these interactions and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our models bridge this gap by predicting the phenotypic outcomes of molecular interactions, enabling applications such as:

- **Phenotype-driven AI models for in silico drug screening**
- **Phenotype-based AI models for high-throughput experimental screening**
- **Phenotype-directed in silico drug refinement and optimization**

We aim to provide comprehensive AI-driven solutions for the life sciences industry, including drug discovery, biomedical research, and personalized medicine.

### **MindCell**: [mindcell.ai](https://mindcell.ai)
A comprehensive multi-modal LLM system for modeling entire cells, enabling phenotype-driven digital cells, animal models, and human simulations for drug screening and validation. We enhance LLM training by using synthetic data generated by a multimodal code translator, where the outputs from specialized AI models serve as the input corpus, allowing for simulations of life at multiple layers:

- **Molecular-level modeling:** Predicting molecular mechanisms of treatments, such as DNA changes, epigenetic modifications, RNA expressions, protein expressions and modifications, and metabolite changes.
- **Cell-level modeling:** Predicting cell phenotypes and responses to treatments, including processes like cell cycle, division, differentiation, death, senescence, migration, and cell-cell interactions.
- **Tissue-level modeling:** Predicting tissue health status and behaviors in response to treatments, covering processes like tissue regeneration, repair, damage, remodeling, aging, and diseases.  

Together, these products harness the power of LLMs and AI to drive breakthroughs in life science research, accelerating drug discovery, and advancing efforts to cure diseases and extend healthy lifespans.
